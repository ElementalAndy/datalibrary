DONE
* remove all unnessesary stuff from public interface. No unneded symbols should be exposed from dl.
* fix how dl_tlc loads dl.so/.dll
    - read from system paths ( 1. same path as dl_tlc 2. system installed )
    - add flag to dl_tlc to specify shared lib to use in unittests
* add dl_reflect_get_type_id( const char* type_name  ), to be able to build binds without exposing hash-function.
* unittest for python should work and be incorprated into build-scripts
* make interface more consistent
    - consistent order of parameters between functions
    - consistent nameing of functions, dl_instance_*, dl_convert_*, dl_txt_*, dl_util_*
    - consistent nameing of parameters to functions.
* rename StrHash, user need not know that it is a string-hash ( it might not even be later on! ). dl_type_id?
* code-style should be a c-isch interface. HDLContext -> dl_ctx_t etc.
* rename targets linux32 -> linux_x86 and linux64 -> linux_x86_64
* remove all adding of m_, p, S when generating headers from dl_tlc. Let users define their struct-names in type-lib!
* base-types in generated headers need to be configurable and default to uint32_t and friends.
* rework functions to retrieve instance-info from dl_instance_endian, dl_instance_ptr_size, dl_instance_root_type to dl_instance_get_properties(dl_instance_properties* )
* dl_load_instance and friends should take dl_type_id even though the do not need it. Use it for error reporting.

BEFORE 1.0
* get it to build on all platforms, again ;) ( linux i386, linux amd64, win32, win64, xenon, ps3 ))
* linux x86 has alignment 4 on double, dl do not support it. FIX!
* rework text-format for arrays from #1 to the same syntax as inline arrays.

* write readme and tutorials.

LATER
* add check for versions in data so errors are thrown if typelib and packed data of older version can not be loaded.
* get pointers to work in python-bindings again.
* unittests should pass valgrind. ( might be done in 1.0 if there is not much to do )
* unittests for C#-bindings.
* break out C#-bindings and python-bindings to their own library?
* more platforms
* multi-dimensional arrays.
* pure c-headers generated as option? ( remove c++ extras ) --cpp or -c to dl_tlc
* benchmarks need to be written
* there are quite a few ugly type-casts in the code, cleanup needed!
* create some benchmarks that measure pack/unpack speed.
* errors from txt-packing should not report error to stdout, dl_txt_get_last_error()?
* unittest that are cross platform 
    - pack on 32 bit -> unpack on 64 bit should be possible localy
    - pack on little endian -> unpack on big endian is harder. Do via network?
* add functionallity to stream txt_pack and unpack
* cleanup in libdl.py and dl_tlc.py
* EDLType should not need to be exposed by the lib in the way it is now!
* dl_tlc should be built around a python-lib so one can embed type-library building.
* unittests to check that DL_ERROR_TYPE_MISMATCH is returned from all functions when it should be.
* dimensions to array and inline_array.
* export pure c-headers?
* buffered parsing?
* unicode-strings!
* SIMD-byteswap of arrays?
* could one use a concept close to a xor-linked-list to not need traversal of entire struct when patching pointers? would this work with convert
  functions? 
* Is the "root" element needed in text-format?
* Better type:ids, right now type-ids are calculated as name-hash but they sholud be calculated by member types and name to be 
  able to determine that they do not match.
  
  example:
	  MyStructVer1 { uint32 m_Int32; }
	  MyStructVer1 { uint32 m_Int32; uint32 m_Int32_2; }
	  
  or typeid:s could be generated as 16-24 bits typelib:id, 8-16 bits enumeration of type in typelib. Would give faster type-lookups.
  ( find typelib, direct indexing )
  On could also add information in typeid as one byte if the type has sub-arrays for optimized packing!
  
  // these are not the same type any more, or are they?
* Question: is it viable to get it to compile with -pedantic for gcc?

EVEN LATER
* bindings for other languages?
